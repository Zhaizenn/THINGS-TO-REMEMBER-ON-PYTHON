Things to Remember
• Python is a case-sensitive language. This
means, Variable and variable are not the
same.
• Always give the identifiers a name that makes
sense. While c = 10 is a valid name, writing
count = 10 would make more sense, and it
would be easier to figure out what it
represents when you look at your code after a
long gap.
• Multiple words can be separated using an
underscore, like this_is_a_long_variable
